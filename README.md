# covid_data_preprocessing

Since late 2019, the world has been impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic, which the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic and a public health emergency. 
In this project, conducted by three students, we aimed to create forecasts for comparisons between countries and industries. To do this, we created this project, which involved collecting, processing, and visualizing publicly available data. Through our analysis, we aimed to provide a better understanding of the characteristics and patterns of the Coronavirus pandemic development and make genuine comparisons and visualizations to provide a more comprehensive depiction of the data. 

My role in this project was to create a python project to pre-process the data and give an output in csv format for the front-end side of the project. main.py uses covid-cases data files in a csv format. After that, it format the input data and give output in csv format as well. The pre-process included filtering, normalizing and aggregating the data.
